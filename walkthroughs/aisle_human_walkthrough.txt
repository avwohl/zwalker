-- 210 OR SO ENDINGS TO PICK UP THE PHONE BOOTH AND AISLE --
--- By Spinster/Zaratustra --- http://zara.verge-rpg.com ---

I believe this is the more or less complete set of commands that
will give endings in PUTPBAA. Some that give the same endings 
(like most KILL synonyms) were skipped.

Commands are marked in a 'compacted' manner: That is, NOTIFY (ON,
OFF) denotes both NOTIFY ON and NOTIFY OFF work. WAVE (-, ME, 
PANTS) implies either WAVE by itself or WAVE ME or WAVE PANTS will
work.

Commands marked with '*' were found with TXD. Shame on me.
