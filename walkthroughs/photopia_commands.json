    "about photopia",
    "photopia is a text adventure similar to zork. i'm not going to tell you",
    "what the real story line to this adventure is -- it will spoil the fun of",
    "finding it!",
    "there are two main differences between photopia and a traditional adventure",
    "like zork. and you need to know them to solve the game!",
    "1. in photopia, the verbs ask and tell have been replaced by the command",
    "talk to. an example of the syntax of this command is talk to",
    "salesperson. after you have written the command talk to, you will be",
    "presented with a menu of things you can say -- for example, ask",
    "salesperson about shop.",
    "2. if you try to move around and the game responds \"you are not carrying a",
    "compass\", you can still move around with the command exit.",
    "in the car with rob",
    "for this scene, just wait around. you can talk to rob if you want, but i",
    "wouldn't recomend this for children because it contains strong",
    "language. (i did talk to rob once just to see what would happen, and i'm",
    "only twelve years old)!",
    "on the red planet",
    "well, the solution to this is extraordinarily easy as well. just go down",
    "from the spacecraft, and go any direction you want until you get to the",
    "greenhouse. i recommend you keep your directions simple, because you'll",
    "have to go back with the opposite directions. for example, if you went",
    "northwest, north, northeast, southwest, south then southeast, for example,",
    "you will have to go back back southeast, south, southwest, northeast, north",
    "then northwest. oh, buy the way, to get the container type get undamaged",
    "container or get unbroken container, i've forgotten which it is, now. once",
    "you've gotten back to the landing site, just go up to the spaceship and",
    "you've finished this section of the game!",
    "saving allety's life",
    "just exit twice, get in the pool, and follow gabby's instructions!",
    "when you are evacuating from the space ship",
    "just press the blue button and go down.",
    "in the undersea castle",
    "now the sollution to this section of the game is quite tricky and i only",
    "got it by accident. just explore the casttle for a bit and then you'll find",
    "the throne room. get the pickaxe and the shovel. read the description",
    "carefully when you try to get the pickaxe -- it's a hint on how to get out",
    "of the castle. now, how do you get out, i hear you ask. now rumbling coming",
    "from the keep sounded suspicious. in fact, it was the roof of the castle",
    "falling off! so head to the keep and go up the stairs. and while you're at",
    "it, read the vivid descriptions of you being pulled out by the waves, and",
    "your tenacious strugggle to get to the shore.",
    "in the dark",
    "just wait around. this is not the sequel to the hitch hiker's guide to the",
    "galaxy!",
    "the golden beach",
    "first of all, the obvious thing to do is get up. get your seed pod and",
    "your shovel. then get a gold coin. you can try getting the nuggets or the",
    "rings -- although it won't work, it's actually quite ammusing! go north and",
    "then dig with the shovel. the shovel might have broken, but now you can get",
    "a treasure chest! go north again, (you can't take the platinum seashell)",
    "and go northwest, and you've finished the gold scene.",
    "in the garage",
    "just exit, tell alley to come inside, tell her about astronaut selection",
    "then tell her about space camp!",
    "sky blue",
    "take off your spacesuit, go up twice and go down twice.",

    "alley.",
    "the forest",
    "examine the trees, wait till the wolf starts wimpering, open the tresure",
    "chest, get dirt then drop it, ask the weather man for some rain, and give",
    "the coin to the weather man.",
    "in alley's bedroom",
    "ask alley where she gets her ideas from. after the long transcript, just",
