    "3nd and *final* revision",
    "by bonni mierzejewska",
    "this is as complete as one person (that person being me) can make it.  many",
    "thanks to those who contributed feedback to improve this walkthrough.  'tis",
    "the last revision.  any typos are here to stay.",
    "century park",
    "you begin in century park on new year's eve, 1999.  there's a party raging",
    "that is giving you a headache, and you're trying to avoid it as long as",
    "possible.",
    "go east.  this is the beer tent, and you'll catch sight of that intriguing",
    "stranger in black (everyone was supposed to wear white to this party, as you",
    "know if you read the party ticket in your possession).  get the sparkler from",
    "the potato.  going back west, you find that black has left you a jigsaw",
    "puzzle piece.  take it.",
    "go southeast to behind the beer tent.  take the rucksack and search the crate",
    "(examine it, too - it's stamped a4).  take the curious device and the tagged",
    "key.",
    "going back nw, go ne to the churchyard.  go e into the church, and e again",
    "into the vestry.  look under the stool and get the pencil; look in the stool",
    "and get emily's book.  go w twice (back to the churchyard) and sketch the",
    "night-jar.  then go sw to century park and w to kaldecki's monument.  climb",
    "the monument and examine the lightning-conductor.  it's made of fuse.  light",
    "it and there will be a boom.  go d and enter the monument.  you won't be",
    "able to exit again, but don't worry.  you don't need to.",
    "in the monument you'll see a display case.  you can examine it and its",
    "contents, but you won't be able to do anything with it for a while, so you",
    "can ignore it for now.  go e further into the pyramid.  you'll find a dusty",
    "room with a table and a clock.  (you can take a look at the room se, too,",
    "while you're here.)  look under the table; you'll find another puzzle piece.",
    "now clean the table and you'll find a puzzle board.  (examine it and you get",
    "the rows are labeled a to d and the columns are labeled 1 to 4.  take a look",
    "at the corner piece you found in century park and turn it until it fits at",
    "a4, the upper right hand corner.  it will light up with a picture of parklands",
    "strobed by laser light.  take the centre piece and put it at c2.  if it",
    "doesn't light up, pick it up again (type \"get c2\"), turn it, and place it at",
    "c2, repeating until the piece lights up.",
    "now, get the ormolu clock and set it to 59 (\"set clock to 59\").  press c2",
    "(pressing a4 does nothing, because you've solved that now).  you will be",
    "transported.....",
    "flat over the street",
    "don't try the door.  it's locked, and you haven't got the key.  however, the",
    "tagged key you found in the crate fits the dresser.  unlock the dresser and",
    "open it and you will find another jigsaw piece.  about this time, black will",
    "come through the door.",
    "shake hands with black.  (i don't know why, but this gets you a point.)  just",
    "let black talk; you'll find out a lot.  when black asks you if you understand,",
    "say no to get more info.  then just wait around until black gives you the",
    "sniper's rifle.  slip off the safety (\"switch rifle off\") and wait some more,",
    "until the archduke shows up.  unpleasantly, what you must do then is shoot the",
    "duke (\"shoot duke\").  (so much for \"violence is seldom the answer, you know\"!)",
    "sketch the horses.  then wait around a bit.  the time window will open; black",
    "will take the curious device.  watch what black does, so you can do it later.",
    "the device causes the disturbed air to condense into a black sphere, into",
    "which black disappears.  at this point, you can wait until the clock runs out",
    "or simply set the clock to 1 and zip out of there.  (if you don't get",
    "transported right away, type \"look\" and you will be.)  you will be transported",
    "to the disc room in the monument.  go nw, and you're back at the puzzle board.",
    "back at the monument",
    "there's a reason why i don't use pronouns to refer to black.  graham nelson",
    "never does.  black's gender is deliberately left indeterminate.  black on some",
    "occasions displays definitely female behaviour and on other occasions displays",
    "definitely male behaviour.  this allows you to assign to black whatever gender",
    "interests you.  there's a reason for that, too, which will become clear to you",
    "as you continue on in the game.",
    "you might also be wondering why you need to be drawing all these animals.  well,",
    "since this is a walkthrough and a cheat, i'll tell you that you can't win the",
    "game unless you draw at least 4 animals in the course of the game.  some of them,",
    "however, are a challenge to capture on paper and are a challenge in and of",
    "themselves.  i found it interesting to find and draw all of them.  there are",
    "(not much of a surprise here) exactly 16 animals to draw (just as there are 16",
    "puzzle pieces and 16 sections of the land).",
    "the device black took from you will be on the puzzle board.  in addition to",
    "opening the time window, it tells you what year you're in (examine it when",
    "you're in a chapter).  put in your sack.",
    "examine the piece you got.  turn it until the flat edge is at the left and",
    "put it at c1.  it will light up with a picture of a cocktail glass with ice.",
    "from now on, what you need to do to fire up the puzzle is set the clock to",
    "59 (or whatever), and press the chosen location.  press c1 to be transported.....",
    "s.s. titanic",
    "...to the reading room aboard the titanic on the last night of its fateful",
    "voyage.  there's a note for you from black and a newspaper.  read them if",
    "you like.  then go sw to the first class lounge, n to the port promenade",
    "(fore), w to port promenade (aft), s to adjoining staircase, and u to the",
    "boat deck.  ignore the first aid box; you don't need it.  on the boat deck,",
    "move the chairs so you can get to black's chair.  you'll find a book.  get",
    "the book and open it, and an elegant key falls out.  get it.  then read the",
    "book and remember the new distress code: cqd.  now go d and n,e,s back to",
    "the first class lounge.",
    "go e to the first class entrance.  while you're here, go u to the top of",
    "stairs, take note that this is where the wireless room is, and go w to the",
    "gymnasium.  take the jacket you find and go e and d again.  from the first",
    "class entrance, go e to the cabins.  unlock black's door with the elegant",
    "key, open it, and go e to enter it.  there, look under the wardrobe to get",
    "the kaldecki device (kd for short) and another note from black.  get the",
    "long barrelled key from the table and open the porthole.  a jigsaw piece will",
    "fall to the floor, which you can now get.  read the note for a little extra",
    "info about the kd.",
    "the kaldecki device is useful the first time you play the game.  turn it",
    "(\"turn kd\") when you're in a chapter, and it will tell you the number of",
    "jigsaw pieces you have (or have left) to find there.",
    "at some point during your explorations of black's cabin, the stewardess will",
    "enter and grab a previously-unseen-to-you towel.  this is useful if you want",
    "to stick around to the very end for a chance to open a time window.  if not,",
    "you'll have other opportunities to enter a time window.  at some point before",
    "the endgame, you need to do so; the first time you do, you get a point.",
    "now, go back w twice to the lounge, n and w and s to the stairs, wear the",
    "jacket and go w into the smoking room.  wait around until benjamin guggenheim",
    "gives you a letter.  once you have it, go w again into palm court and give",
    "the letter to miss shutes.  she'll squeak and leave, disbanding her ouija",
    "game.  now you can look, and you'll see the jigsaw piece left here.  take it.",
    "now you need to go back to the wireless room.  once there, unlock the door",
    "with the long key, open it, and go e to enter.  there's a morse key here and",
    "charts with morse code on it.  remember the cqd?  you need to key it in now.",
    "it's on the charts.  \"dah\" is a dash, and \"dit\" is a dot; c is -.-. :  q is",
    "--.- : d is -..  and you need to key them in succession with no pauses.  this",
    "solves the temporal crisis here.  the letter you gave miss shutes *has* to",
    "make it to its addressee; you just made sure that miss shutes would be rescued",
    "by the s.s. carpathia.",
    "now you can either escape back to the monument by using the clock, or wait",
    "around for the time window.  examine the towel; on it is the location where",
    "the time window opens.  it will open at the precise minute that the titanic",
    "sinks.  be there before 2:10!  as soon as you see the air disturbance, press",
    "the button on the curious device.  the titanic will make it's plunge for the",
    "bottom, but you'll survive long enough to dive into the black ball.",
    "if you decide to stay until the bitter end, turn off the alarm on the clock, so",
    "you don't get whisked back to the monument prematurely.  just don't forget to",
    "turn it back on again if you want to leave a chapter using the clock!",
    "a note about the compass directions.  if you lay them out, you'll notice that",
    "graham nelson has the titanic heading due east.  i find this improbable, since",
    "the titanic sank just south of newfoundland heading for new york city, but",
    "maybe he knows more than i do.  :->",
    "in the black ball",
    "just wait around a turn or two.  you can't do anything.",
    "in the land",
    "search around until you find the pyramid.  very little of the land is open at",
    "this point in the game, and there's no point in trying to explore the mist.  i",
    "think if you enter the land from the titanic chapter you arrive outside the",
    "chinese pagoda.  go in and take a look if you like.  the pyramid is e of the",
    "pagoda.  this will take you to the sw corner of the pyramid; to enter the",
    "door, go ne.",
    "whether you use the land or the clock to get back to the monument, you are",
    "always transported to the disc room.",
    "back at the monument",
    "back at the monument, you've got these two pieces, and edge piece and a corner",
    "piece.  the corner piece is a1, so turn it until it will fit there.  it will",
    "light up with a picture of mould in a petri dish.  turn the edge piece to fit",
    "at b1.  it will light up with a picture of an invalid in bed.",
    "it doesn't matter which piece you press next.  here we'll go to a1.",
    "clarence wing",
    "okay, first open the lower door and go d into the asthma lab.  draw the",
    "white mice, then go n to the lab assistant's office.  penicillium?  mould?",
    "ah!  we're here to help fleming discover penicillin!  get the jar.  you can't,",
    "but you will find a note from black.  go s and u, open the upper door, and",
    "go into fleming's laboratory.  look under the bench and get the petri dish",
    "you find there.  get the certificate, which dislodges a jigsaw piece.  get it.",
    "occasionally fleming will interrupt your nosing about; the first time he does,",
    "he'll leave his heavy suitcase.  put the dish on the suitcase and push the",
    "suitcase e (it's too heavy for you to carry).  wait around until fleming comes",
    "along, finds the petri dish, and dashes off.  you've just solved the temporal",
    "crisis.  wait a bit to take the time window if you didn't opt to take the one",
    "on the titanic.",
    "back at the monument",
    "the piece you found at a1 needs to go at c3 (a racing steam locomotive).  do",
    "the take/turn/put routine on it if it doesn't light up the first time you",
    "place it there.  now, on to b1.",
    "temps perdu",
    "you're in paris.  ignore the door at 44 rue hamelin for now and go north.",
    "you can read the paper if you like.  go n again, into the streets of paris.",
    "locals will go by, and the game tells you what direction they go.  go that",
    "way!  after several turns of this, you will find a flask of absinthe.  drink",
    "it.  you'll have an hallucination of being at a dance party, and black will",
    "be there.  dance with black.  this ends the hallucination, and somehow you're",
    "back at avenue kleber.  now go south twice.  see the coin?  you can get it",
    "now.  take it and go n, open that intriguing door and go e into it.  give the",
    "coin to the bellboy and get into the lift.  go to the top floor, get the",
    "piece, and down to the fifth floor.  exit the lift and go e into the",
    "apartment.  get the tea tray, which turns out to be a puzzle piece.  you have",
    "to get it again, because somehow in getting it, you dropped it.  also get the",
    "madeleine (which can also be referred to as \"cake\").  get back to the lift and",
    "down to the street.",
    "go s and w to the maison du the.  you'll see a forgotten bowl of jasmine tea.",
    "dip the madeleine in it and eat it.  you'll have yet another dreamy sequence.",
    "this time you need to swing the pendulum, and you're back at the maison du",
    "the.  see that paperole that was on the clock?  it's on the floor now.  take",
    "it and go back to the fifth floor apartment.  drop the paperole, and you've",
    "solved the temporal crisis (restoring the crucial final passage to proust's",
    "last work).  there are no animals here to sketch.",
    "hang around a turn or two if you want to take advantage of the time window.",
    "you'll start to notice that every time you return to the land, there's more",
    "of it.  the land is a 4x4 grid of sections...and so is the puzzle.  every time",
    "you place a jigzaw piece in the correct place, the corresponding section of the",
    "land coalesces from the mists.",
    "back at the monument",
    "okay, now you've got two more pieces.  the edge piece goes to b4 (the snow",
    "lands), and the centre piece goes to b2 (kitty hawk and the wright flyer).",
    "but for now, let's go to the train at c3.",
    "lenin's train",
    "you're on the train lenin took when he returned to russia.  go e, wear the",
    "uniform, open the trunk and search it, then go back to the corridor and unlock",
    "the west compartment door with the little key you found.  open it, enter,",
    "there's a man tied up here!  but don't free him, or you end up getting shot",
    "during the october revolution.  search him instead, which makes him furious,",
    "but you need that permit.  out to the corridor again, go s into the soldier's",
    "compartment.  be polite!  ask them for a piece of pashka.  they'll obligingly",
    "tell you to have it.  take it and go n twice to lenin's compartment.  lenin",
    "himself is here, but he's not paying attention to anyone.  go ne.  there's an",
    "engaging little boy here, and a piece of paper which you need.  give the",
    "pashka to the boy, and he'll let you have the paper.  take it and give it to",
    "lenin, who will sign it.",
    "now take your chit and go nw.  you'll be in line for the smoking room.  wait",
    "until you get in.  you've got barely enough turns to accomplish what you need",
    "to do here.  look under the bunk, open the vent, get the tray (which turns out",
    "to be a puzzle piece), and put it in the vent.  no, it's not gone forever.",
    "go s before the other passengers kick you out.",
    "now go ne again and n to the back end of the train.  there's a bomb here!  get",
    "it and throw it.  you've just saved lenin's life so he can start the bolshevik",
    "revolution, more's the pity.  get the piece, too.  now you can either go back",
    "s once to advantage of the time window, or use the clock to get back to the",
    "monument.  there are no animals here to sketch.",
    "at this point, i have a theory as to your gender.  since you're able to",
    "plausibly wear the british army uniform, my guess is that your gender is",
    "supposed to be male, making black female (you'll find out later in the game",
    "that you are definitely opposite genders).  don't let your 1990's liberated",
    "sensibilities trip you up here - in 1917, it was improbably to find any female",
    "british army officers!",
    "back at the monument",
    "the piece from lenin's train goes at a2.  let's go there.",
    "abbey road",
    "not much to do here.  you peer in the window and take a look at four scruffy",
    "young men...yes, the beatles.  black is here.  wait around.  black will start",
    "humming loudly, presumably to throw the beatles off.  the only way to restore",
    "the quiet they need is to kiss black.  graham nelson has a little romance in",
    "him!  hang around for the time window or use the clock.  there are no puzzle",
    "pieces here, and no animals to sketch.",
    "back at the monument",
    "where to next?  let's do the pieces you acquired in paris next.  press b2 this",
    "time.",
    "kitty hawk - the flyer",
    "there's a paper dart here.  pick it up and throw it a few times.  notice what",
    "happens?  now go d to the railing.  the wright brothers are using this railing",
    "to get their flyer off the ground.  examine the crowd and draw the yorkshire",
    "terrier.  go e and get the bread and the anemometer.  go e again into the",
    "machine shop.  there's a mandolin here.  take it and play it.  play it again.",
    "you're getting better!  play it until you can play vivaldi.  now go e into",
    "the kitchen.  there's a mousetrap here!  put some bread into the trap, wait",
    "until the mouse comes by.  you might have to wait a while before the mouse",
    "actually pauses to inspect the trap.  immediately sketch the mouse.  now",
    "go w and up into the loft bedroom.  get the cap.  you don't need it, but now",
    "you can see the box of mosquito powder, which you do need.  take it and go",
    "back down.  go w to the hangar and n.  you'll be at the bottom of the hill.",
    "the reason why the flyer keeps landing so quickly is because the windspeed",
    "goes up and down in cycles (you can verify this with the anemometer), and",
    "they're missing the peak.  wait there until orville lands and play the",
    "mandolin for him two times in a row.  he'll like it and stick around.  then",
    "wait, and the flyer should fly this time.  *now* you can get near the flyer,",
    "because everyone has raced off to town to telegraph the world.  examine it;",
    "there's a loose square on the aileron.  get it - it's a puzzle piece!",
    "unfortunately, you get caught in the wires and they have to extricate you, but",
    "they don't care at this point.  you end up on the beach.  there's a bottle",
    "bobbing in the waves.  wait until it's almost to hand, and get it.  there's",
    "a message from black in it.",
    "now go back to the machine shop.  shake the mosquito powder and examine the",
    "heater.  see the little holes?  put bread in them.  if you hadn't shaken the",
    "mosquito powder, the mouse would come along and steal the bread.  the powder",
    "repels it.  the heater will explode, and you can get the lid, which turns out",
    "to be another puzzle piece.",
    "the time window does show up here, but not in the machine shop.  i *think* it",
    "opens at the beach (look around for it if you like - but be warned that it",
    "only exists for about 2-3 turns).  if you don't want to fool with that, take",
    "the clock back to the monument.  you should have drawn two animals here.",
    "back at the monument",
    "okay, the centre piece from the flyer is b3 (ghost plane), and the creased",
    "edge piece from the heater is d3 (cabbages).  but we're still working on the",
    "pieces we got from paris, so let's press b4 this time.",
    "in the wilderness",
    "something's gone a little wrong.  you're in a white place.  black is there,",
    "confused, and asks you if you can see ahead.  it doesn't matter what you do or",
    "say.  the whiteness resolves on the next turn into a cold whiteness, and",
    "you're in the snowlands.",
    "snowlands",
    "sketch the snow goose, and go e until you run into the snow leopard.  don't",
    "worry; it won't hurt you.  just draw it and head back w until you're either",
    "back at tundra with the snow goose or the copse of fir trees.  if you end up",
    "at the copse, go sw into the shed, get the grain and the broom and ne again,",
    "and e to the tundra.  if you end up in the tundra, go e to the copse (might",
    "as well examine the nest while you're there) and get the broom and the handful",
    "of grain from the shed.  if you end up in the snowy basin, go u to the tundra,",
    "e to the copse, etc.",
    "now go u.  get the coil of cable on this crag and go d twice to the snowy",
    "basin.  sweep the snow.  yes, sweep the snow.  you uncover a disc around a",
    "ten foot shaft.  examine the disc and you find a ring attached to it.  tie",
    "the cable to the ring and go d.",
    "wonder of wonders, there's a us missile here.  you weren't in siberia after",
    "all!  examine it; you'll find a hatch.  open the hatch and go inside.  you",
    "don't have much time now - the missile just started vibrating.  press the",
    "green button (releases a puzzle piece from the hatch) and the blue button",
    "(solves the temporal crisis).  out, get the piece, and up.  quickly.  if you",
    "hang around you will die.  also quickly untie the coil of cable from the ring",
    "before the missile fires and the silo shuts on it; you'll need it once more.",
    "go up and give the handful to the goose by *dropping it on the ground* (this",
    "will keep her busy while you plunder her nest), then w to the copse.  throw",
    "the cable at the nest and pull the cable *twice*.  you'll get the puzzle",
    "piece; be sure to pick it up!",
    "doing things in this order is more efficient (having been informed by email",
    "and after trying this order myself).  however, you probably won't be able to",
    "take advantage of the time window this way, since it opens shortly after the",
    "missile fires.  (the time window opens shortly after the temporal crisis is",
    "solved, regardless of whether or not you have all the puzzle pieces to be",
    "found.)",
    "you should have found two pieces and drawn two animals in this chapter.",
    "back at the monument",
    "okay!  the corner piece from the nest goes at d4 (barge), and the edge piece",
    "from the missile goes at c4 (moon).  let's do the pieces from kitty hawk.",
    "these are the hardest puzzles in the game, in my opinion.  let's do b3 now.",
    "ghost plane",
    "time is precious here.  go n to the cockpit.  there's a control panel with",
    "buttons and dials, and the engine fire light is on.  press cuteng/l (cut left",

    "in the navigator's chair and turn on the radio.  immediately get up and press",
    "aut/p (autopilot).  now scamper s twice to the fusilage ring, and go w to",
    "the west bomb bay.  examine the hole, then examine the control there.  it says",

    "back to the fusilage ring, put everything in your sack and drop it.  examine",
    "the locker and get the safe (you can't carry the safe and *anything* else).",
    "take the safe e to the east bomb bay and drop it.  now you've got some waiting",
    "to do.  this is a long chapter, so turn the alarm off on your clock.",
    "get your sack and go back to the cockpit.  if you like you can go d and",
    "examine and clean and read the pinup there, but you don't want to do what it",
    "says.  what you need to do now is lower the plane.  push the control column",
    "forward until you're at about 760 feet.  wait.  wait some more.  when you",
    "get to about 20% fuel, start paying attention.  a few turns later (pay",
    "attention!) forest will be rushing under you.  press lower/u *now*.  this",
