    "the way to do it ;), by mike wallis (mike@jeamland.org)",
    "----------------",
    "this is the solution to \"anchorhead\" - not exactly a walkthrough, more of a",
    "story about how to finish the game off. the game is split into four \"days\",",
    "with a set of puzzles to complete each day. once certain puzzles have been",
    "completed, the day moves to \"evening\", where you are expected to go home &",
    "sleep, unless, of course, you are unable to do so due to unforseen",
    "circumstances. there are some puzzles that can be done at any time after a",
    "certain point, and by no means are all the puzzles expected to be completed",
    "in order. certain puzzles are optional; the game can be completed without a",
    "full score if you forget to do certain things, or couldn`t be bothered, or",
    "something.",
    "so, without further ado;",
    "day one: takin' it easy...",
    "--------",
    "you have arrived in anchorhead, carrying nothing but an umbrella, a trenchcoat,",
    "the clothes you stand up in & your wedding ring. if you read the blurb at the",
    "start, you find out that michael, your husband, has run off to the university",
    "to check out some paperwork, leaving you to pick up the keys to his family",
    "house. if you wander around a bit, find the university, and michael, he'll",
    "get a little exasperated at you if you don`t have the keys, so you'd better",
    "find them. you start out outside the agent's office, which is inexplicably",
    "locked, so you try & find another way in; the alley to the se looks promising,",
    "so have a look down there. you`ll see a fence, which you should examine, and",
    "some garbage cans (or \"bins\", as i insist in calling them). there is also a",
    "window. if you have read the \"about\", you'll notice a dead giveaway in that one",
    "of the hardest things mr. gentry found to code was shoving the can under the",
    "window - so give that a go. if you stand on it, open the window, and close your",
    "brolly, you can enter the window, leading into the file room of the office.",
    "you can look things up in the files, but what? well, head to the main office,",
    "where you'll find an answering machine with \"play\" and \"delete\" written on it.",
    "if you press play, you'll hear \"verlac\", the name of michael's uncle (or",
    "cousin, or whatever), so go & look up verlac in the files, where you'll find",
    "the keys to the house. ignore the styrofoam cup; it tastes pretty foul; it",
    "kind of suggests that the office has been deserted for a day or so, though.",
    "head to the university library, where michael is working, but on the way, head",
    "up the side road just past the pub, where you'll find a blank wall, with no",
    "obvious way around. head back sw (not se), and go find michael. before you",
    "disturb him, go & have a look at what you need to get a book out of the",
    "library; the sign next to the circulation desk tells you what you need. while",
    "you are there, have a look at what michael is reading. quite a weighty tome,",
    "so maybe you should try & have a look at it yourself later. for now, go & say",
    "hello to your husband, show him the keys, and try & find the house. if you go",
    "too far wrong, michael will tell you it isn`t in that direction, but if",
    "you ask him for directions (\"michael, where is the house?\") he is a bit iffy",
    "as to exactly where it is. so, head to the obelisk, and find your way out of",
    "town to the south - michael will stop you going too far wrong (from the",
    "obelisk, go e, s, sw, nw). read the notice, and unlock the front door. head",
    "into the house, but don`t explore too far - you don`t have a torch. it's safer",
    "if you just close & lock the front door, head into the bedroom, & get into bed.",
    "when you get into bed, \"sleep\", and remember what you dream (pretty harrowing",
    "stuff, and not pleasant to remember, but make a mental note anyway).",
    "day two: something rich & strange.",
    "--------",
    "you wake up to the sound of michael showering. if you want to, listen to him",
    "for a while - he comes out with some highly amusing comments, in the light of",
    "subsequent events, but the important thing here is to get the means of reading",
    "what he was reading yesterday, so examine his pants. search them (it is a good",
    "idea to \"search\" stuff as well as \"examine\" them), and you`ll find his wallet.",
    "search his wallet as well, and get the faculty card. he'll come out, tell you",
    "that he loves you, & them promptly sod off to his study to work. men, eh?",
    "anyway, put on your clothes, and your trenchcoat - which can hold an amazing",
    "amount of stuff - and go into the bathroom, picking up the towel, and putting",
    "it in your coat. head back through the bedroom, picking up your umbrella and",
    "keyring on the way - put the umbrella in your coat as well - and have a wander",
    "around the house. there are a lot of things you can do, now, and there isn`t",
    "a particular order you must do them in, so lets take them one-by-one.",
    "1. the key in the cellar.",
    "from the foyer, head n to the back hall, and w into the kitchen. grab the",
    "flashlight from the kitchen, and head for the pantry, turning the torch on",
    "first. in there is a broom, which comes in very useful for various bit of the",
    "game, so get it. unlock the cellar door (you did pick up your keyring, didn`t",
    "you?), and head down. look in the wine cellar - nothing important there for",
    "the moment, so go into the storage room. have a good poke about, and while",
    "you are at it, have a closer look at the spiders web. before you get the key,",
    "though, clean the web with the broom - that way, the spider won`t get you.",
    "put the iron key on the keyring - a useful tool, that - and head upstairs.",
    "2. the pages in the children's bedroom.",
    "from the landing, go e and then s. the contents of the jewellery box are",
    "worth a look, so get the locket, and have a look at the contents. you can",
    "wear that, so go ahead. have a look at the bed, as well. and under it. the",
    "scratches look as if the bed has been moved a few times, so give that a try.",
    "have a look in the hole, & read the pages, providing you with a fair bit",
    "of useful names, and dates. while you are at it, head into the library north",
    "of the room, & pick up & read the book you find there. if you go e & disturb",
    "michael, don`t stress about it, he'll just tell you to go away. on your way",
    "out, pull the cord, revealing the attic.",
    "3. the book michael was reading.",
    "head back to the university, picking up the newspaper in the town square on",
    "your way (read it, giving you a bit more information about what is going on),",
    "and go to the circulation desk. remember the title of the book from the",
    "register? ring the bell, and show michael's id card to the librarian, and",
    "ask the librarian for the book (\"ask librarian for history\" works as well",
    "as anything). read the book - a bit more information, there - and a slip of",
    "paper drops out. keep hold of the paper for now, & read the book again. the",
    "history will give you some names & dates you should look up later, so make a",
    "note of them. chilling stuff. you can`t leave the library with the book, so",
    "ring the bell & give it back to the librarian.",
    "4. the magical shoppe",
    "from the narrow street, head nw up the twisting lane. the blank wall that",
    "you saw yesterday has suddenly picked up a bit of graffiti - remember your",
    "dream? the graffiti, when read, will point you west, so head that way now.",
    "head into the cauldron, where the proprietor will be glad to help you,",
    "especially if you ask him about things he has in his cabinet. specifically,",
    "you want the amulet, but he'll give it to you if you ask him about it. wear it,",
    "for now.",
    "now you have picked up some names & dates, go look them up in the courthouse",
    "births & deaths records. it is possible to work out the names of the male",
    "verlacs pretty much back to croseus, but don`t stress about doing that just",
    "yet. once you have had a look, head back home.",
    "hmm. a bit quiet? head up to the study, and see if michael is home. well, he",
    "isn`t, but it means you can have a good nose around his study - and his laptop.",
    "if you examine the screen, you'll notice he has put his password protector on.",
    "it is a 4 digit code, a date he is likely to remember, so how about his",
    "wedding annivarsay? remove your ring, and have a look on the inside - the",
    "date is june 28th, so how about that? type 0628 on the laptop, and have a read",
    "of what he was typing. those numbers look familiar? read the slip of paper that",
    "you found in the library, and you'll see the two match. head back to the",
    "library, and examine the bookshelves. a somewhat out of place copy of poe will",
    "stand out, so get it, and reveal a safe hidden away behind the cases. the safe",
    "is a dial-type, so try turning the dial to the numbers on the slip of paper",
    "and the laptop, and lo! the safe opens. search the safe to find a puzzle box",
    "and a flute. both of these come in useful, but how to get the darn box open?",
    "well, someone knows how to do it. for now, though, put the box in your pocket,",
    "and head back into the study. have a good look around the fireplace, which",
    "should jar some memories of dreams - \"i don`t know what it opens yet, but i",
    "have a good idea\" - so try turning the spheres. if you go sw you walk into a",
    "maze which is worth wandering around so you get a good idea how to move about",
    "it later, so have a wander in it, while you are not constrained by time limits.",
    "before you do that, however, pick up the letter opener - it will be useful -",
    "and open the desk drawer, finding another book that tells you a bit of info.",
    "(sw from first room leads you to the portrait in the front room, nw from there",
    "leads you to a hole which you can`t see through yet, sw and se from there",
    "leads you to the observatory, the way out). have a look at the telescope, and",
    "then head se, leading you into the crawlspace in the attic. head for the attic,",
    "and examine that locked door. annoying, isn`t it? you can't see through the",
    "keyhole, so what could be blocking it? how about the key? put the newspaper",
    "under the door, and put the opener in the keyhole. something drops onto the",
    "paper, so get the paper, and the key falls off it. get the key, and put it on",
    "your keyring - and then unlock the door. search the room, but pay particular",
    "attention to the straw, where another locket is found, this time gold. wear",
    "this, and head to the kitchen again, this time going out the back door. head",
    "for the crypt, and unlock & open it. there are quite a lot of coffins here, so",
    "routing through them could take some time, but you know the names of two people",
    "at least who have been buried here - edward & william. have a look for their",
    "coffins - notice a difference? open william's coffin, & get what you find",
    "there. head back towards town, go to the cauldron again, and show the puzzle",
    "box to the proprietor, who will open it, revealing a disk. head to the pub,",
    "and have a look under the table, where a flask of alcohol will be found.",
    "resist the temptation to drink it yourself. while you are there, you might as",
    "well pick up the lantern, but blow it out first. have a quick wander around the",
    "town if you havn`t already, orientating yourself with the important places,",
    "have a chat with the orderly at the asylum if you want - talk to him about his",
    "magazine, if you like - and then go find the bum who isn`t a bum at all. listen",
    "to him for a bit, and he'll tell you he's thirsty. he'd rather have the flask,",
    "than the coffee, which will open him up a bit. you have to ask him some pretty",
    "direct questions, and you need to be persistant, but you'll be able to find out",
    "that he was the verlac family doctor, and that he delivered william & edward,",
    "and apparently buried william. you know that that is bogus, as in william's",
    "grave you just found the animal's skeleton. show the skull to the doc, and",
    "persist in your questioning about william (\"show skull to bum\", \"bum, tell me",
    "about william\", \"ask bum about william\", and repeat in various ways) until he",
    "breaks down, and tells you. he gets a bit funny about wanting protection,",
    "at this point, so give him the amulet from the cauldron. he'll give you the",
    "copper key, and evening will fall. head se, get the tin of oil, and head back",
    "home. michael isn`t back yet, so stress a little bit, but forget about it for",
    "now & have a bath, after remembering to lock the back door. turn the torch off",
    "as well, if you like (i get paranoid ;), & clamber into bed & go to sleep.",
    "you'll have another of those remarkable dreams again... so remember them.",
    "day three: a certain kind of something.",
    "----------",
    "the day is split up into a few distinct segments that must be completed. it is",
    "a good idea to complete them in order, but, of course, you don`t _have_ to.",
    "well, apart from part 2 & 3 - no choice about that - and you don`t really",
    "have to do a lot of part 1 - just get the name and work out how to open the",
    "cellar, really, will do it. anyway...",
    "part 1. the burial mound.",
    "after michael has woken up & wandered off so that you don`t know where",
    "he is, head for the secret passageways in the study, and sw, look through",
    "hole, & nw, look through hole. head for the observatory, put the disk in the",
    "slot, & look through the telescope - write down the name you hear, as it",
    "comes in useful. go down to the wine cellar, and have a look at the wine",
    "bottles that mike was playing with - examine all of them, and make a note of",
    "the dates on the labels, and the letters on the bottles. head off to the",
    "records office, if you feel like, and check out the dates on the labels;",
    "you'll find corresponding names to the letters on the bottles. head back to",
    "the cellar, and turn the bottles in date order, earliest first, based on",
    "what you know about the family - croseus' birthdate is unknown, but he was",
    "the first, so start with his (\"turn <letter>\" where letter is the letter on",
    "the bottle is a bit faster than typing \"turn pinot\", esp if you forget which",
    "order the bottles go in). this will open the secret door in the cellar,",
    "leading into the windy passages. you`ll get to a pit, eventually, with w &",
    "e ledges - examine both edges, and you`ll see footprints on one of them; head",
    "that way, and you`ll cross the pit safely - this direction _does_ change. on",
    "the other side, you`ll see another odd-angled corridor, which leads off to",
    "the crawlspace in the attic - don`t worry about it for now. head down the",
    "stairs, until you come to a door; examine it, and the symbol, and this should",
    "make you think of a passage in \"wardes & seales\", about speaking the name of",
    "a deity to open a door; this is that door. the only deity that resembles the",
    "symbol is the name of the thing you saw through the telescope, so say that",
    "name (you can`t open the door, even if you know the name, unless you have",
    "picked up the points for learning the name), and the door will open. have",
    "a good look at the obelisk - checking out the pictograms is always good - and",
    "have a good look at those columns as well. try blowing the flute, and then",
    "try blowing it with holes covered by your fingers (when trying this out,",
    "remember to remove your finger from one hole before covering the next, until",
    "you know which holes to cover). when you have worked out which holes to cover,",
    "(the inspiration for this should come from the \"cryptical\"), blow it.",
    "don`t stand on the altar when blowing the flute.",
    "part 2: the slaughterhouse.",
    "before leaving the house, check the pile of luggage in the foyer. see a bag?",
    "in that bag is a hairpin, which will come in useful later, so pick that up.",
    "ok, you've checked out practically everywhere in the house, so go for another",
    "wander around the town itself. the cauldron has disappeared again, but never",
    "mind. head south to the deserted lane, and remember your dream - you headed",
    "west, didn`t you? try heading west, and a magical route will open up.",
    "head along until you get to the slaughterhouse, get everything you see, and",
    "have a look at the picture. odd, isn`t it? oh well, head south, and move the",
    "plywood. have a look down the well, and search the bones, getting the teddy",
    "while you are there. head back out of the slaughterhouse, but wait! whats that",
    "noise? head back to the well, and enter it, _and_ hide under the bones. wills",
    "doesn`t take kindly to strangers, and even if you could show the locket of his",
    "mother to him, he won`t give you time to do anything. anyway, after hiding for",
    "a while, he'll get bored & wander off, leaving you the chance to do a runner.",
    "go back towards town, but you`ll find your route cut off, somewhat, by a group",
    "of people who are a little disappointed in you. head for the church, but go",
    "around the back - you`ll never get through the door in a month of sundays. have",
    "a look at the trapdoor, and then a look at the padlock - something heavy? have",
    "a look at the meat hook, which shows itself as being something heavy, so try",
    "hitting the padlock with the hook. this opens up the church, so go down there.",
    "part 3: the church.",
    "what's down here? the suggestive shape is, sadly, your estate agent. some",
    "people may make jokes about estate agents and this being the best thing for",
    "them, here, but not i. search the body a couple of times, until you find the",
    "key, and open the furnace, just for morbidity's sake. head to the stairwell,",
    "but don`t jump just yet. stow as much as you can in your pockets - the torch,",
    "more than anything - and jump. you`ll reach the riser, but everything in your",
    "hands will drop down the shaft. don`t worry about it for now, just go &",
    "explore the church. get the robe, and have a read of the black tome on the",
    "altar - but don`t carry on reading it. examine the cross - that may give you",
    "an idea about what went on in this church, and then head for the belfry. get",
    "the rope, and then go back to the stairwell. drop the robe down the shaft, and",
    "tie the rope to the railing. trust your instincts here, and go down the rope.",
    "it can`t be far to the bottom, so let go of the rope, and lo! you have escaped",
    "the church.",
    "part 4. errata. much of this can be done in any order.",
    "you are now in the sewer system. turn the torch on, and get everything that you",
    "may have dropped down the shaft. if you head nw, and u, you can open the door",
    "with the copper key, bringing you out at the riverside. if you exit there, you",
    "can visit everywhere south of the bridge; if you stay in the sewer system, you",
    "can go under the river, and eventually come out behind the fence in the alley",
    "next to the estate agents. go in there in the usual manner, and unlock the",
    "drawer with the steel key you found on her body. read the letter, and put the",
    "key you find on your keyring. head out - the files don`t have anything about",
    "the mill or the lighthouse - and go & find mrs. greer. she lives - read the",
    "newspaper - at #12, mill town rd, which is, presumably, by the paper mill. if",
    "you go there and knock on the door, and show her the teddy, she will invite you",
    "in and answer any questions you may have. search max's overalls, get the key,",
    "make your excuses & leave. head for the lighthouse, and unlock it, and have a",
    "wander around there as well - make sure you remember the directions you go in,",
    "as well. you may not have time to go \"oh, is it sw or se?\" and pick the wrong",
    "one. when you have finished with that, head for the mill. have a look around,",
    "but there is no obvious way of opening the gate, so head for the foundations.",
    "search _everything_, but especially the thickets. you should be able to unlock",
    "the hatch with the long key you stole from mrs. greer, so open it & in you go.",
    "it might be an idea to leave the robe you picked up here, so that you can get",
    "it later without it being taken off you.",
    "part 5: the mill.",
    "the passageway you are in is fraught with danger; time it wrong and you could",
    "end up steamed. the safest way through is to turn the steam off, rather than",
    "trying to judge the mechanics, so take your towel, and put it on the wheel. the",
    "wheel is now cool enough to touch, and so turn it so the needle drops back",
    "down - the corridor is now safe enough to saunter through. at the end is a bit",
    "of a stuck hatch, so just persist in going through it - eventually it will",
    "open. in the mill itself is a maze and an optional way of avoiding it. if you",
    "have kept hold of your broom, you can avoid the maze; if you havn`t, you must",
    "get through the maze pretty quickly, otherwise you could end up as flambe. the",
    "maze is only 6 rooms, so you should be able to map it pretty easily - just",
    "save & undo a lot. however, if you have kept your broom, you can just go over",
    "the top. have a look at that control panel, and try pulling the lever. a big",
    "block of something you can stand on appears from the roof. now push the",
    "button - and it goes back up. so, if you stood on the block, and had something",
    "long enough to push the button with... so stand on it, and push it with the",
    "broom. when you get to the catwalk, just \"out\" will get you off the block, and",
    "you can check out the device blueprints that the agent alluded to in her",
    "letter. if you read the blues, you'll notice that the main focusing mirror has",
    "two numbers, one crossed out, and another; in the rack is a collection of",
    "mirrors - but the rest of the device isn`t here. presumably, these mirrors are",
    "spares, so no-one will notice you taking one... get the calipers, and measure",
    "the mirrors, & take the one with the corresponding size to the not-crossed-out",
    "number. you can take any of the others as well, but remember which is which.",
    "put the mirror in your pocket, and head back the way you came to go back to",
    "the mill road.",
    "6. the lighthouse.",
    "who is that? michael? well, lets follow him, then. have a look in the",
    "lighthouse - which is presumably where he went to - and then head back out",
    "of the lighthouse. michael turns up, and he isn`t too happy, but at least he",
    "is still enough of your husband not to kill you on the spot, so he just knocks",
    "you out.",
    "the last night: all the best freaks are here.",
    "--------------",
    "you wake up inside a padded cell. presumably, you are inside the asylum, the",
    "one you spent hours trying to get in earlier in the game. how to get out?",
    "well, if you examine the door, you`ll notice it is a bit loose on its hinges -",
    "so violence is the answer to this one. hit the door a couple of times, and you",
    "are out of the cell. however, you are still stuck in your straightjacket, and",
    "you are without your belongings, so the first thing is to get out of the",
    "jacket. have a close look at the window. see those cracks? one of them is big",
    "enough to hold the shard of glass on the floor. if you \"rub glass\", you can get",
    "a hint about how to get out of the jacket, so put the glass in the crack, and",
    "then rub it - freedom! have a look in the closet as well - all your belongings",
    "were placed there, the nice chaps they were. get everything, and try to find",
    "your way out. but wait! what's that on the window, further down the corridor?",
    "bloodtains? how did edward die? well, if you asked the orderly, he would have",
    "told you that edward bashed his brains out, so this _could_ be his cell...",
    "have a look in there (\"unlock west\" \"open west cell\") and search the tear in",
    "the padding for edwards last testament. read it - giving you another clue - and",
    "then head for the stairs.",
    "that gibbering you have been hearing was not simple background.",
    "to escape the madman, you need to get to the exit, where you find the orderly,",
    "sadly demised, but at least he won`t tweak any more pimples. his magazine is",
    "on the floor just outside the door, but his key is a little more out of reach.",
    "if you try & go for the key, the madman will catch up with you & start eating",
    "your brains, however, if you get the magazine, and show it to the madman he'll",
    "suddenly be distracted by it & stop chasing you quite so much. this gives you",
    "a few useful seconds to try & get the key. it is out of reach, but you have",
    "something that could snag it - your umbrella (about tells you to keep hold of",
    "the umbrella :-) so \"snag cell key with umbrella\". remember to keep all your",
    "keys on your keyring, so do that, and unlock the gate. when you go through it,",
    "the madman starts to chase after you again, but he gets distracted by the",
    "corpse, so head n, and thus escape the asylum.",
    "head towards the town square, but before you can get too far, you notice the",
    "mob returning. to stop yourself being caught, go & hide down the side alley,",
    "and just wait until the poor old doc has quacked his last. head back to the",
    "square, and regain your amulet - didn`t do _him_ much good, but never mind.",
    "while you are here, you could do something to disrupt the ceremony that you",
