    "[note:  i've made only a couple of changes to this solution, which was",
    "written with curses release 12 in mind.  there are no new puzzles in the",
    "current release 16, but the ambiguities from my original solution have been",
    "addressed.  this solution does not give you step-by-step commands, so it",
    "should help novices learn how to translate their desired actions into",
    "\"textadventurese.\"  before you start reading, please go back to the puzzle",
    "you're having trouble with and give it another shot.  this is an extremely",
    "difficult game, and if you can solve it without once reading below this",
    "sentence, you'll feel great because of it.]",
    "curses may be one of the best text adventures ever written, and for",
    "that reason it deserves the effort which is required to solve it.  it",
    "is one of the few text adventures i have played where the puzzles",
    "become a part of the story, rather than a series of obstructions.  this",
    "walkthrough is not meant to be used as an instant gratification method",
    "of getting through the story, and i hope that it will not be used as",
    "such.  more than anything, this walkthrough is intended to cut down on",
    "the exceptional amount of traffic on r.g.i-f., which for months has",
    "been almost exclusively curses-oriented.  if you are looking for hints",
    "which will help you get through certain parts of the game which yor are",
    "stuck on, my suggestion is that you use a word search to skip to",
    "exactly where you are stuck.  this will help you avoid ruining what can",
    "be a very rewarding experience.",
    "i also suggest that new players immediately use the 'help' command",
    "to get all of the background information on the game.  graham nelson,",
    "the author, has provided an excellent set of instructions for your use.",
    "1) when saying a single word to other characters, the format is: \"say",
    "<word>\" (no punctuation).",
    "2) when making a request or saying a word to a particular object, the",
    "format is: \"<object/person>, <word/request>.\"  i'll cover these instances",
    "in detail later, but if \"guess the verb\" is holding you down, then this",
    "is the way to do it: \"painting, lagach\" or \"evans, give me the <word>.\"",
    "3) often you'll have to take items out of the rucksack before you can",
    "use them, so if it suggests that you're not holding something that",
    "you're fairly certain you have, \"get\" it before you decide the game's",
    "gone nuts.",
    "4) at times, the dumbwaiter will not be where you want it to be.",
    "just get to the nearest wheel and turn it for the dumbwaiter to show",
    "up.  if the wheel won't turn, then \"turn off wheel\" will free it up for",
    "you.",
    "5) the game doesn't take kindly to swearing.  if you should swear",
    "(and the game is pretty strict -- 'bugger' is as bad as any four letter",
    "word), a cake of carbolic soap will appear in your inventory.  wash",
    "your mouth out with soap, and you'll be able to continue.",
    "6) make a map.  i'll only go so far in guiding you by the hand --",
    "if you have to get from one end of the house to the other, and i've",
    "shown you the way before, you'll have to figure it out yourself the",
    "second time.",
    "7) many of the solutions actually change the state of other rooms",
    "without notifying you.  that's another reason to explore a bit on your",
    "own before using this indiscriminately.  in fact, explore a lot, or the",
    "intricacy of the game will be lost to you.",
    "and now, the walkthrough --",
    "curses -- version 12",
    "the walkthrough",
    "you should begin the game by collecting all of the objects which are",
    "immediately available to you.  in order to do this efficiently,",
    "however, you should begin by taking care of the flashlight situation",
    "and by finding something to help you carry the many items which will be",
    "available to you.  [if you find yourself wondering \"what flashlight",
    "situation?\" then it's way too early for you to be using this walkthrough.]",
    "head north to the old winery, and -- well, there's another problem that",
    "should be taken care of, as the attic key just slipped between the floor-",
    "boards.  let's not get sidetracked, though -- go west and south to the",
    "airing cupboard.  look under the sheets and you'll find an old, heavy",
    "wireless radio.  push that north to aunt jemima's lair and turn it on before",
    "going west to the potting room.  aunt jemima is busy pouting right now, so",
    "she won't be very friendly -- in fact, if you try to take those ever-useful",
    "gardening gloves right now, you'll see just how unfriendly she can be.",
    "wait ('z' works well) a few turns until the radio fades in, and then you can",
    "take the gloves.",
    "head east twice, wear the gloves, and open the demijohn.  you don't",
    "need these items yet, so head south twice and then go southeast to the",
    "east wing.  head east from here and you'll be in the east annexe, where",
    "your flashlight's battery will begin to bite the dust.  that's no",
    "problem, though, because if you're wearing the gloves you can search",
    "the insulation rolls to find a brand new battery waiting for you.  open",
    "the flashlight, empty it, put the new battery in and then close it up",
    "and you'll have a lightsource for the rest of the game.  you also want",
    "to head south now, where your ancestor ebeneezer's rucksack is waiting",
    "for you.  grab that, because it can hold a miraculous amount of stuff.",
    "ok, now that we've got the rucksack we can pick up a few items.  head",
    "north and open the cupboard before heading north again.  grab the",
    "painting of mad isaac and the gas mask and go back to the old winery.",
    "now head east, grab the wrench, and enter the dumbwaiter (you might as",
    "well grab the chicken bone which is lying here, as well).  pull the",
    "rope and you'll drop down into the basement.  get out of the dumbwaiter",
    "(just 'out' will do nicely) and grab the robot mouse before going",
    "south.  drop the mouse, and tell it to go east.  understand that",
    "conversation is the only limit in this game, and must be done",
    "correctly, so type 'mouse, go west.'  now the mouse is out of earshot,",
    "so you can't talk to it directly.  talk to the hole instead: 'hole, go west.'",
    "there we go -- now have the mouse go west twice more, then north once, west",
    "once, and north again.  ah!  something happened!  send the mouse back the way",
    "it came, and out will come that missing attic key.  grab it, head to the",
    "dumbwaiter and pull the rope again.",
    "[note: if you haven't done so already, before you go up in the",
    "dumbwaiter head west and south to the demon.  this guy can be pretty",
    "helpful.  just \"ask demon about <object>\" or \"show <object> to demon\"",
    "and you might get a hint.  just remember that he is a demon, so",
    "whatever he tells you is likely the opposite of the truth.]",
    "now you should be somewhere between the attic and the basement.  get",
    "out of the dumbwaiter and put on the gas mask before heading north.",
    "unlock and open the door, and if you want you can head north and take a",
    "look around, although we're not going to do anything here quite yet.",
    "incidentally, at some time far in the future we'll go through this door",
    "a second time and pick up ten points for it -- i really have no idea",
    "why we don't get them now.  anyway, head back to the dumbwaiter and",
    "pull the rope again to get back to the attic.  let's do some more",
    "garbage collection.  head west and get everything from the demijohn,",
    "then head south and look at the teachest.  this book, the history of",
    "the meldrews, contains a wealth of information which is necessary to",
    "complete the game.  if you haven't taken a good look at this history,",
    "you should look up every name you come across in your travels (a list",
    "of these names appears at the end of the walkthrough).",
    "head east from here, lie down on the bed, and sleep.  yes, you are",
    "quite the vivid dreamer.  go east and north and take the mascot that's",
    "there -- read this description carefully, because an important magic",
    "word will appear.  now, drop the mascot, because it's cursed and you",
    "won't live long if you insist on carrying it around (plus you'll lose",
    "fifty points for taking it out of the dream).  head south, west,",
    "southwest and east to escape the dream.  stand up and grab the",
    "dictionary and scarf before going west and south where you'll take",
    "everything from the cupboard (did i mention that you'll be carrying",
    "around a lot of stuff?).  open up that mysterious little parcel.",
    "hmm... i wonder if jemima likes chocolate?  just to make sure, why",
    "don't you head back to the potting room and offer the box to her.  now,",
    "quick explanation for why you're going to choose one particular color.",
    "if you flip through the calendar east of the potting room, you'll",
    "notice many different daisies pictured.  there is only one that should",
    "be of any particular interest, however --  the merlyn's hat daisy,",
    "which is yellow.  if you looked up isaac in the history of the",
    "meldrews, you must have noticed that isaac had a particular interest in",
    "merlin, so when jemima asks you what color you're looking for, i",
    "suggest \"say yellow.\"",
    "while jemima works on this, head back to the east wing and go west.",
    "pull the cord to turn on the darkroom light and take a look at the",
    "postcard to read its invisible ink, and while you're at it, grab the",
    "flash.  look at the photograph, as well -- ah, another meldrew!  look",
    "roger up in the history of the meldrews, because there's a clue there",
    "that will be important later on.  now, go east twice and north back",
    "into the cabinet.  turn the crank here to open the window, go up to the",
    "roof and then head northwest.  ah, a key!  unfortunately, when you try",
    "to pick it up you'll get a ghastly little surprise, but it's easily",
    "remedied.  if we wanted to take the time, we could look up joshua in",
    "the history and discover how to foil him, but since we're in a",
    "walkthrough just give him the chicken bone.  elusive key, isn't it?",
    "head back into the cabinet and put the torch and the brass key into the",
    "fireplace.  this will be a tight squeeze, so drop everything else",
    "before going west into the dark.  go down and you'll be in a",
    "not-entirely-pleasant little priest's hole.  grab everything and then",
    "open the hatch with the brass key so you can drop down.",
    "i'll bet you think you've done a lot by now, but no such luck.  head",
    "west into familiar territory.  now, if you turn the wheel here the",
    "dumbwaiter should come down to us, but if you look at the wheel you'll",
    "see the problem.  just \"turn off wheel\" (yes, it's odd, but a lot of",
    "the grammar here is unusual) and then turn the wheel to bring the",
    "dumbwaiter back downstairs.  this would probably be a good time to head",
    "back to jemima and claim your daisy chain.  warning: do not drop the",
    "daisy chain.  you can probably get another one, but it's really not",
    "worth the trouble.",
    "head back to the cabinet and collect all of your stuff and then",
    "prepare for a little time travelling.  go south out of the cabinet,",
    "then west and south to the observatory.  while we're here, clean that",
    "glass ball -- it'll come in handy later.  go west into the library",
    "storage room and tighten that loose joint with the wrench.  grab both",
    "of the books and check out the romance novel first.  who the hell is",
    "marie swelldon?  worry about it later -- for now, read the book of",
    "poetry and ...",
    "yep, it's france at the turn of the century.  what did you expect?",
    "head north and up to madame sosostris's reading room and push the bell",
    "there.  i've never seen much of a difference between choosing odd or",
    "even here, but just as a disclaimer i'll admit that i've never tried",
    "anything but 'even,' myself.  she'll do a quick and somewhat",
    "frightening reading and then hustle you back onto the street.  don't",
    "accept such a rebuke!  go right back upstairs and grab the tarot cards",
    "(although only one of these cards will actually be useful, the others",
    "can be fun).  go downstairs and west and take a look at the mural",
    "(another name -- look it up!  remember, look up every name that you",
    "see!) before going outside again.  back on the street, head west and",
    "get the silk handkerchief.  wave it and board the boat.  now if you",
    "take long enough, this guy will literally hand you the solution: say",
    "time.",
    "so here we are, back at the garden stream.  now let's see what we've",
    "got here.  head northwest and climb the family tree, then look at the",
    "maze.  notice that strange open space in the southeast corner?  good,",
    "now head back down and drop the medicine bottle right here.  head west",
    "twice, get everything, board the garden roller, and turn it on.  go",
    "east twice (ouch!  what was that?) and then east once more to plow over",
    "one of those garden statues.  head west again, and then drive north",
    "into the maze (if you want to know why we're driving here, try walking",
    "in).  the directions through the maze are: north, west, west, north,",
    "north, north, north, west, west, west (it's a simple maze, thank god).",
    "get off the roller ('out' works fine), get the miniature, then board",
    "the roller again and go back where you came.  turn off the roller (this",
    "is probably just anality on my part, but it's better to be safe than",
    "out of gas) and get off it again.  grab the tablet (childproof lock?",
    "hah!  piece of cake!) and you're ready to do some more time travelling.",
    "go back up to the observatory (by now i'm assuming that you can find",
    "your way around) and head south.  turn on the slide projector and turn",
    "the knob.  remember that ace of cups which appeared when you left",
    "paris?  put that card into the projector's slot now, and then head",
    "south, right through the wall.  this is where the game really starts to",
    "get interesting.  you may want to listen in to the conversation",
    "upstairs, but when you're ready, search the crates and you'll find a",
    "model ship.  pick up the mounted bottle and pull the anchor on the",
    "ship.  put what's left of the ship into the mounted bottle, and you've",
    "got a beautiful little ship in the bottle (i've always wondered how",
    "they do that!).  now just look at the ship, and we're seasick.",
    "a little acrobatics are now in order.  climb the mast and get the",
    "flag which is flying from it.  once you've got a firm grasp, go port",
    "and the whole business will crash down around you.  pick up everything",
    "that came down with you and go fore, where you'll find a green branch",
    "which should also be taken.  head aft twice, turn the wheel and then go",
    "down the anchor chain to end up back in the attic again.",
    "now, put the fool into the projector (you might want to remove the",
    "ace of cups first) and go north.  see how handy that ball can be once",
    "it's clean (if nothing happened, turn the knob on the slide projector",
    "and try again)?  to find out what just happened, go back to the \"dead",
    "end\" where you found the rucksack.  head east down the fire escape and",
    "then northeast towards town.  go north, and look at the cross.  another",
    "name -- why don't you look up gerard in the history of the meldrews?",
    "marie swelldon -- isn't that the name of the romance novel?  if you're",
    "good at putting two and two together, then you should now know that",
    "marie swelldon is the pseudonum used by roger meldrew's wife.  at this",
    "point figuring out the real name is fairly simple.  take the letters",
    "\"meldrew\" out and we're left with \"aislon,\" which when unscrambled",
    "becomes \"alison.\"  so, look up alison meldrew in the history and voila!",
    "if you head back to the dead end and push the south wall, alison's",
    "private writing room will be revealed.",
    "in the writing room, you should continue your trend of sleeping on",
    "everything which seems even remotely designed for that purpose.  you",
    "should put the ship's flag on the bed first, though, to provide a",
    "comfortable blanket.  once you're asleep, you'll have another of those",
    "vivid dreams.  wait once, and watch what the weird guy does with that",
    "rod.  i wonder where you can pick up one of those?  when he's gone,",
    "head east twice and turn the wheel.  now, this is one of the few",
    "semi-arbitrary puzzles, but the thinking as expressed by those who",
    "claim to have solved it is that, if you look up at the status bar,",
    "you'll see the word \"dreaming?\"  the traditional way to see if you're",
    "dreaming is to \"pinch me,\" so go ahead and do that.",
    "get out of bed now and look in the mirror.  actually, take that sooty",
    "old stick from the fireplace out of your rucksack first and then look",
    "in the mirror.  you'll notice that the sooty old stick doesn't show up",
    "in the mirror for some reason.  if you haven't looked up isaac in",
    "thehistory yet, do so now.  using his date of death as a reference,",
    "look up 1792 in the prayer book.  merlyn's hat, eh?  hidden items, eh?",
    "why not wave that sooty old stick while we're wearing that yellow daisy",
    "chain, just to see what happens.",
    "this is a major theme in the game -- there are a total of ten rods",
    "disguised throughout, and you have two of them.  the old timber spar is",
    "the other one, so wave that.  now the question is: how do we tell one",
    "rod from the other?  before we answer that question, break the windows",
    "so you can gain access south to the balcony.  look under the window",
    "sill and then pick up the gold key which you reveal.  what do you",
    "suppose this key belongs to?  well, go back to the \"attic\" room where",
    "the game began and close the attic door.  get the box that is revealed",
    "and then open the door again on the off chance that you get separated",
    "from your light source in the future.  unlock the box with the gold key",
    "and open it to reveal a four leaf clover.  i'd suggest you give this a",
    "wave, as well.",
    "next you'll want to head down to the coal bunker, where you'll see",
    "that your little dream actually opened up that sandstone passage you've",
    "been so curious about.  head east twice and you'll be in a large",
    "octagonal room with lots of strange egyptian stuff.  before we go about",
    "the serious business, get everything and break the frame on the",
    "charcoal sketch.  you'll reveal a dog-eared old letter by doing so, and",
    "you'll want to pick that up, as well.  now open the coffin and read the",
    "inscription inside.  the dog-eared old letter will supply you with the",
    "necessary tools to decipher this, so now put one of your featureless",
    "rods into the coffin.  close the coffin (i hope you were wearing your",
    "gloves!) and open it again, and your rod is named.  do the same with",
    "the other two rods (you can actually put all of them in at once, but",
    "only one will be named at a time), and then head southeast.  hang the",
    "picture of isaac meldrew on the hook here and then get the sceptre",
    "which is hidden in the umbrella stand.",
    "[note: about that magic word, 'lagach.'  if you want to travel around",
    "to many of the places you've been, one way of doing so is by",
    "approaching an artwork and typing (for example) 'mural, lagach' or",
    "'painting, lagach.'  this will cycle you through the artworks which you",
    "have seen, however i must point out that this can be very tiresome, and",
    "there are really very few times when it's necessary.  a complete list of",
    "places you can 'lagach' to appears at the end of this walkthrough.]",
    "ready to travel some more?  head up the staircase here and then go",
    "up again and you'll be back in the servant's room.  this will supply",
    "you with a nice short cut between the two most distant areas of meldrew",
    "hall.  let's go to hamburg this time -- remembering the postcard, look",
    "up 1420 on the map of hamburg and you'll end up at the museum of",
    "arcana.  just for the heck of it, head south and marvel at the wonders",
    "of modern security.  to get through it, we'll have to be a bit",
    "innovative.  turn the revolving door once and then go northeast.  of",
    "course!  where else would a beach ball be?  push it southwest, and then",
    "push it south and the security problem will be behind us.  grab the",
    "tarot box and open it up so you can reach its contents more easily",
    "later on.  head east and break the cabinet (yes, occasionally violence",
    "is the answer).  get everything from the cabinet, and immediately make",
    "sure that you are holding the medicine tablet (i.e. take it out of the",
    "rucksack) and the rod of returning (this is not arbitrary -- we are",
    "simply doing the puzzle a little out of order).  if we wanted to, we",
    "could just lagach through the still life in the other room (which, if",
    "we were doing things in order, is exactly what we would do), but this",
    "is more useful and interesting.  wait around for a while and the druids",
    "will grab you, drug you, and throw you in jail.  before doing anything",
    "else, eat the tablet to neutralize doktor stein's poison.  now grab the",
    "shepherd's crook and show that alison's dream taught you something --",
    "strike the rod of returning and point it at yourself (\"me\").  if you",
    "didn't prepare well enough beforehand, doktor stein has got some nasty",
    "plans for you.",
    "believe me, that was a close one.  now you should be somewhere in the",
    "attic, and hopefully ready for more time travelling.  this time,",
    "replace the fool in the projector with the miniature and go south",
    "again.  this time, you've gone way back to the building of the hedge",
    "maze.  my first advice to you is to leave the bean pole alone for now.",
    "head east as far as you can go, and then head south as far as possible.",
    "you should now be in a whitewashed area which, coincidentally,",
    "corresponds perfectly with the inaccessible section of the garden maze.",
    "head west, and squeeze the weed killer bottle which you picked up from",
    "the garage.  having killed off all of those seeds, you can now go all",
    "the way back to the northwest corner of the maze.  now be ready with",
    "the rod of returning.  get the bean pole, strike the rod, and get out",
    "of there in a hurry before capability meldrew ships you off to",
    "australia.",
    "shall we see what we've accomplished?  first, go to the library",
    "storage room and pick up the book of twenties poetry which you left",
    "there.  go back to the maze, jump in the roller and go north twice and",
    "east three times.  get off the roller, get the marble rose, and then go",
    "down.  this mural should set off a few bells in your mind.  a star?  a",
    "maiden?  a bundle of wands?  look in the tarot box from the museum and",
    "you'll see something familiar.  maybe madame sosostris holds a key to",
    "what this means.  read the poetry book again and go back to the reading",
    "room.  this time, though, we're going to stack the deck.  in order for",
    "them to be pulled in the correct order, you should put the eight of",
    "wands on the deck, followed by the maiden, and finally the star.  push",
    "the bell, and madame sosostris will go a little nuts and give you an",
    "oak quarterstaff (three guesses as to what this is).  after you've been",
    "hustled into the street once again, go back and retrieve your cards",
    "before going to our friend on the river boat for a return trip to",
    "meldrew hall.",
    "you may not realize it, but you've collected a number of rods.  use",
    "the coal bunker to get into the octagon room again and wave the bean",
    "pole, the shepherd's crook, the quarterstaff, and the eight of wands.",
    "now use the coffin to name them all, and you'll have a total of seven",
    "wands to play with.  go southeast and 'lagach, painting,' hopping from",
    "artwork to artwork until you're back at the bronze mural.  activate the",
    "rod of bronze by striking it and pointing it at the bronze mural to",
    "reveal a passage going down (be sure to grab the book of poetry",
    "beforehand).",
    "[note: if you think you've had enough of being led by the hand, you now",
    "have access to another hint machine.  if you go south from the clearing",
    "outside of the garage, you'll find a runner bean plant.  use the rod of",
    "stalking on that plant and, naturally, a beanstalk will appear.  up the",
    "beanstalk you'll find an angel who works similarly to the demon, but who",
    "will always tell you the truth.]",
    "when you head down into the passage, get the key which you're",
    "standing on first.  then head east twice and read the gravestone",
    "beneath your feet.  another name -- look it up.  now head back to the",
    "jagged passage and go south.  although the smell is really bad here, take",
    "a deep whiff, anyway -- no, really, just type 'smell.'  strange, eh?  do",

    "the priestess any question -- the format is \"priestess, tell me about",

    "same basic answers.  the first one tells you of a place with six arches",
    "-- we haven't seen that yet, but jot down the \"x paces and y paces\"",

    "(cryptically, of course) that the medicine tablet is the antidote to",
    "doktor stein's drugs (if you really want to see what she says, you can",

    "this scene for a while, because it looks like a pretty decent party,",
    "but if you look under the table, you'll notice that things aren't as",
    "much fun as they seem.  harken back to the priestess's clue and take a",
    "look at that scarf.  using the order of the colors as a guide, pull the",
    "blue wire, the green wire, the black wire, and finally the red wire,",
    "and wait a little while with your fingers crossed (don't miss that",
    "reagan quote -- it's a classic, like war of the worlds).  once you've",
    "safely got the timer in hand, the rod of returning will get you home",
    "safely.",

    "and put the red battery inside.  then set the timer and put the timer",
    "inside before closing the flash.  finally, put the flash into the",
    "device and wait for the fireworks.  pretty cool -- 50 points, and the",
    "puzzle is optional, something i really don't understand.  now check",
    "your inventory, and you'll notice a slight discrepancy.  this is not a",
    "problem.  go east twice to the mosaic and do your lagach trick until",
    "you're back at the frieze.  head upstairs, and there's all of your",
    "stuff, safe and sound.",
    "and now, alexandria.  this is, imho, the endgame, but only because",
    "the actual endgame is so much easier than this part.  if you've been",
    "just cruising through the walkthrough so far, put it away now and try",

    "then follow your poor traumatized cat into alexandria.",
    "this place is bustling with activity, but luckily austin has suddenly",
    "decided to be affectionate (you just had to show him who was boss) and",
    "will follow you around for a while.  the first thing you want to do is",
    "to head north and drop the smooth round stone into the grating.  you",
    "can wait around to see what happens if you like, but then head south,",
    "southeast, and southwest to the necropolis.  now go south and look at",
    "the writings (making alexandria lagachable) and head north again.  blow",
    "the bird whistle and the birds of prey will direct you to a certain",
    "tombstone.  take the cloak of many colors from the tombstone, wear it,",

    "safely head southeast into the royal museum while the guards outside",
    "kneel and bow and scrape and grovel in front of your cat.",
    "once inside the museum, start by going south and anointing yourself",
    "with oil ('anoint me'), a ritual which you might have seen mentioned",
    "with the inscription in the necropolis.  go back north and southeast,",
    "where you'll want to take the spindle from the rickety globe that's",
    "there.  back at the birdcage, wait a couple of turns until a messenger",
    "drops two tubes into the pingeonhole.  get these tubes and prepare a",
    "little practical joke.  to the northeast you'll find callimachus and",
    "apollonius, two competitive poets with extremely different writing",
    "styles (you can find out about this by looking them up in the",
    "dictionary).  before going there, though, switch the scrolls in the",
    "tubes -- i.e. put the short poem in the alpha tube and epic poem in the",
    "kappa tube.  now head northeast and give the kappa tube to callimachus.",
    "follow callimachus south and give the alpha tube to apollonius, and",
    "then pick up the spoils of this little war before heading out of the",
    "museum.",
    "with the museum out of the way, you should go north and then west,",
    "where you'll find the smooth stone and rusty key.  pick these up and",
    "then, if you wish, play dice with the old sailor.  the object is to",
    "figure out how to count from one to six in this language, and if you",
    "play long enough you'll figure it out ('throw die' or 'drop die' -- 'roll",
    "die' might not work).  however, if you were in the mood to figure things",
    "out you wouldn't be reading this walkthrough.  the numbers, from one to six,",
    "are: thu, zal, si, ca, mach, and huth.  once you're through playing around,",
    "go back to the grating, unlock it with the rusty key, go down and enter the",
    "skiff.  pick up the adamantine heart which you find there, and then set sail.",
    "don't worry, we'll be back soon.",
    "now for some mundane stuff.  to start off, head back to the octagon",
    "room and identify the rods you've picked up.  wave the spindle and the",
    "amber hairband and put them in the coffin to find out what they are.",
    "you should have a total of nine rods now, leaving only one to collect.",
    "head up the servant's staircase and go through the fire exit and",
    "northeast.  head down and wave the green branch, driving off the corn",
    "crake.  get the nuts, go northwest, get the wooden ball, and take your",
    "favorite route to mad isaac's painting.  now head northeast to an area",
    "of meldrew hall we really haven't dealt with yet.  go east and then",
    "north and get the croquet mallet, then go south and east again to the",
    "croquet lawn, where we find six arches, just as the priestess",
    "mentioned.  i hope you jotted down those numbers from earlier, because",
    "you need them now.  the syntax here is \"walk x paces <direction>.\"  in",
    "general, the first number which the priestess gave you refers to east",
    "or west directions, the second number north or south, so there are four",
    "different places where you might have to dig (incidentally, if you",
    "haven't looked at the gardening implement from the garage, do so now).",
    "my experience has shown that the treasure is usually located east and",
    "north, but i can't guarantee it.  once you've dug up the strongbox with",
    "the spade, unlock it with the gothic iron key and open it to reveal an",
    "astrolabe, which you want to take.",
    "now to finish with the truly mundane (only so because this paragraph",
    "is related to an optional puzzle), drop the hard wooden ball and hit it",
    "with the croquet mallet.  oops -- maybe you had better fill that hole",
    "first.  follow the squirrel northwest and put the nuts into the hole in",
    "the wall of the summer house.  once the squirrel has chased after the",
    "nuts, go south and blow the bird whistle.  this should shake loose the",
    "gold watch for you to take.  with that taken care of, head to the",
    "painting and 'lagach' yourself back to alexandria.",
    "head north into the necropolis and put the amber gem into the socket",
    "on the tombstone.  go down and do exactly what i feel like doing right",
    "now -- lie down on the couch and go to sleep.  now do it again.  and",
    "again.  and one more time.  now wait around, and watch the guards do",
    "their thing.  once they're finished, go to the west and die.  now die",
    "again.  and again.  continue until you're back in the \"present,\" and",

    "you might try to go down that tunnel [northeast?].  care to try again?",
    "you could keep trying, but when you give up and head east and west again",

    "this corresponds to the \"iii iiiiii i\" writings we examined earlier.",
    "now, enter the coffin and close the lid, and when the computer asks if",
    "you are crazy, just close the lid again, because you are.  just when",
    "all seems lost, go up, and you will see why we took the precaution of",
    "annointing ourselves with oil.",
    "ok, we still have one more trip to alexandria left, so head out to",
    "the bronze mural and lagach yourself there.  from the crossroads, go",
    "southeast, remove the cloak of many colors and turn it inside-out.  if",
    "you happened to glance at the painting in the undertaking room, you",
    "might have noticed that the priest of sosostris wore a gray cloak.",
    "wear this cloak, open the door to the tower, and enter.  put the green",
    "oak quarterstaff on sosostris's table, and she'll give you a keepsake.",
    "next head northwest, turn the cloak inside-out again, and go northeast",
    "into the parade.  go north twice and you'll be standing outside of the",
    "palace of alexandria.  if you want a laugh (and have 'undo' or 'save'",
    "capability), immediately go north again.  if you want to live, then",
    "remove the cloak of many colors before going north.",
    "once inside the palace, wear the purple sash, which will allow you",
    "to walk around.  are you familiar with those wonderful mazes where you",
    "have to drop items in order to identify rooms?  well, try it now and",
    "you'll see that that won't fly.  the papyrus fragment from the museum",
    "in hamburg actually has the solution, but remember that it's written",
    "backwards.  if you think of the smooth round stone as a compass, then",
    "you'll see that you should go northeast, east, and then south before",
    "typing 'anoppe.'  you will be immediately hustled over to the palace",
    "balustrade.  put the astrolabe on the mounting and then look through",
    "the eyepiece...",
    "...and here you are, at the old church, ready for the last few",
    "obstacles.  before going on, i just want you to remind yourself that",
    "you're going to all of this trouble just to obtain a street map of",
    "paris -- i thought you should try to keep your goal in perspective.",
    "pick up the adamantine hand from the spire and then drop down twice to",
    "the parish.  go west, and you'll find an adamantine knight lying there.",
    "put the hand on the statue, and then screw it on tightly.  do the same",
    "with the head, and finally the heart will be the finishing touch.  use",
    "the rod of fire to do your doctor frankenstein bit, and be kind, this",
    "guy's a little bit on the stupid side.  point east, and follow, then",
    "point east again and follow.  give the marble rose to the knight and",
    "then show him the keepsake which sosostris gave you ('show keepsake to",
    "knight').  once that's taken care of, point west and follow.",
    "this is another 'guess the verb' problem.  what you need to do is",
    "type 'knight, open stone.'  the knight will be confused.  now just type",
    "'open stone' to show the knight what you mean, and if that doesn't",
    "work, try 'knight, open stone' a second time.  once the stone is out of",
    "the way, point down, and your good friend the knight will go bye-bye.",
    "now you've got three high rods, and honestly i don't think it matters",
    "which one you choose; i usually choose love because i'm sappy.",
    "careful, though, those things are hot!  use the rod of ice to cool down",
    "the one you want and then feel free to take it -- you can't stop the",
    "others from falling away.",
    "using this route, dealing with old evans is essentially optional.",
    "since i made you go to the trouble of getting the watch, though, we",
    "might as well take care of this.  evans has a mascot, which is actually",
    "a \"moon\" card which we could have used a while ago to get into the",
    "church.  if you want to grab it anyway, then go south out of the church",
    "and hypnotise evans with the watch.   once he's under, 'evans, give me",
    "the mascot' will score you a few more points and the moon card (which,",
    "as i've already pointed out, is useless now that you've finished with",
    "the church).  if you feel guilty about stealing from the poor old guy,",
    "then head back up to alison's room and, while holding the statue of the",
    "extremely ugly animal, look in the mirror.  evans will gain a pet, and",
    "you'll gain an eased conscience.",
    "now, before we do the endgame, there's one more little puzzle we want",
    "to take care of.  pick up that golden orb from earlier and clean it.",
    "this part is a little strange, so i'll lead you through the reasoning.",
    "if you wait around a while, you will discover that you are basically",
    "inside of a chess game.  if you looked up helene in the history",
    "earlier, you should have noticed that she had a husband named anton.",
    "if you look up anton in the history, you'll find that he was a",
    "chessplayer with a flair for sacrifices.  so there you have it -- use",
    "the rod of sacrifice on white and the orb will be sparkling and golden",
    "and ready for the last step.  head back to the dumbwaiter, go down to",
    "the cellar, and go west, where you'll find that the long wrought iron",
    "key will unlock this last door to the northwest.",
    "it's time to find a home for all of these rods you've collected.",
    "fill the nine sockets with nine of the ten rods, holding onto the rod",
    "bronze, fire, ice, husbandry, luck, returning, sacrifice, stalking, and",
    "the high rod which you chose.  then put the orb into the spherical",
    "opening, strike the rod of infinity, and point it at the lemniscus.",
    "hence, the master game -- your last chance to solve a complete",
    "portion of the game on your own.  take advantage of it, because once",
    "you've gotten this far the rest is a piece of cake.",
    "you are now wonderfully empty-handed.  get the torch, head west, and",
    "go down the rope.  you can't quite reach the yellow daisy yet, so swing",
    "the rope and then grab it.  wear the daisy (these things are just so",
    "damn useful!) before going back up and east.  head northeast, then",
    "east, and then south.  get the horn, continue south, and then east.",
    "get the sandals and wear them -- the die, for all intents and purposes,",
    "is useless.  next, go west twice, open the the cover, and put the torch",
    "into the well -- this is important, because otherwise you wouldn't be",
    "able to guage the distance.  go down into the well, and then east,",
    "putting you underneath the hypocaust.  from this convenient hiding",
    "place, blow the horn, and then -- surprise! -- wave the horn.  use the",
    "rod of language on yourself in the usual manner, and then kick back and",
    "listen as the real reasons for this exhausting quest are revealed.",
    "when the druids are done talking, go west and up into the waiting hands",
    "of the enemy.",
    "for now, there's not a heck of a lot you can do, so wait a few turns",
    "until the saxon spy is thrown into the tent with you.  now you want to",
    "get the pole, thus collapsing the tent, before you head east over the",
    "hot coals (good thing you're wearing those sandals!).  now, get the",
    "blue stone and wave the tent pole.  i'm sure you know what to do next.",
    "once you're safely back at meldrew hall, get the book of poetry and",
    "read it.  this time go east and down.  now, the coup de grace -- wave",
    "the blue stone, and give the fifty-franc note to the map man.  his",
    "question is \"what do you want?\"  although i have a feeling he knows",
    "perfectly well what \"map\" means, you want to \"say carte.\"  your old",
    "friend at the river will help you get back to meldrew hall, and just",
    "for the sake of closure, go back to the attic where the game began and",
    "go down.",
    "and that's it!  i strongly suggest that you take a look at the",
