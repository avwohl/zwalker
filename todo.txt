We recently made tools for Infocom .z games
see ~/src/z2js ~/z2pdf ~/zorkie

PRIMARY USE CASE: COMPILER TESTING
===================================
We built a ZIL/ZILF to .z compiler. The IF website folks were
not happy with the lack of testing.

The main goal of this project is to:
1. Automatically verify a game can be played from start to finish
2. Generate a walkthrough/solution with a known-good .z compile
3. Replay that solution on a new compile to verify correctness

This enables regression testing of the compiler.

APPROACH
========
To an extent z2pdf is a previous attempt at this.
It may not be possible to do 100% puzzle solving automatically.
However, at least a lot of a game can be mapped by:
 - start game
 - preserve state
 - try every vocabulary word
 - try multiple words that can be figured from the parser
 - for each room note the room number and which commands go where
  (room 1  north -> 2, south-> 10, etc)
 - can AI help? in reading what it says at each room
 - try picking up objects and using them

OUTPUT FORMAT
=============
Need to output:
 - Command sequence (for replay)
 - Expected room numbers after each move
 - Expected inventory state
 - Expected output text (or key phrases)

This allows:
 - Replay on new compile
 - Diff against expected behavior
 - Identify compiler regressions
